## Background

This project utilizes the [`go-vibes` framework](https://github.com/amoscookeh/go-vibes) to showcase the use of [genkit-go](https://github.com/firebase/genkit) in building an AI feature.

You may refer to the respective branches to view how I setup an AI powered CI/CD workflow with and without genkit. The results can be found in their respective Github Actions.
